## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- [Styled Components](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inconsolata:wght@200&display=swap) - For paragraph font

### What I learned

This project was useful and taught me how to center a div, add a shadow box effect to a div, which in turn creates more depth allowing the div to appear realistic, and how to link a google fonts into the project, which enables more customization over generic css font-families. The final and most important skill this project allowed me to learn was how to deploy a website using netlify. 

Code snippets, see below:

```html

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">

  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inconsolata:wght@200&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

  

  <style>

    p{

      font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace;

    }

  </style>

```
